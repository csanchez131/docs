# Quick Start

To get the most from Gadget's lighting fast deployment process, development is done on a host computer. Once your code is ready for testing it's compiled and pushed to the hardware device connected via USB using GadgetOS' daemon GadgetOSd. To get started, install the following on your host computer and Gadget compatible hardware. 

## GadgetCLI

Download and install NTC's command-line tool, GadgetCLI [here]. 

## Docker

Gadget makes use of Docker's container system. Dependent on your host computer's OS, download and install the appropriate version of Docker using the below links. For more information on Docker, read [here](https://www.docker.com/).

* MacOS - [Docker CE](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac?tab=description)
* Windows 10 - [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
* Ubuntu - [Docker CE](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-ubuntu?tab=description)

## Flash GadgetOS 

For GadgetCLI to be able to talk to your hardware device it needs to be flashed with the latest GadgetOS image. Find the latest image on our [web flasher](flash.getchip.com/pro).
