# Setup Gadget

To get the most from Gadget's lighting fast deployment process, development is done on a host computer then, pushed to your hardware device through USB using GadgetOS' daemon GadgetOSd. To use Gadget, install the following on your host computer and Gadget compatible hardware. 

## Install GadgetCLI

Download NTC's command-line tool, GadgetCLI [here].
