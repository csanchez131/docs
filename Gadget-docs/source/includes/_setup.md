# Setup Gadget

When working with Gadget, development is done on a host computer then pushed to your hardware device via USB using GadgetOS' daemon GadgetOSd. There are one-time installs that need to happen on your host computer. 

## Install GadgetCLI

Download the command-line tool GadgetCLI [here]. 

## Flash GadgetOS 

For GadgetCLI to be able to talk to your hardware device, flash it with the latest GadgetOS image. Find the latest image by heading over to our [web flasher](flash.getchip.com/pro). 

## Install Docker

Gadget makes use of Docker's container system. Dependent on your host computer's OS install the appropriate versions of Docker using the below links. For more information on Docker, read [here](https://www.docker.com/).
