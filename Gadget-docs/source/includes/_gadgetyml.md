# Configuring Gadget.yml

GadgetCLI's function is built around the gadget.yml configuration file. This is where you define the container's resources, issue commands once a container is started and state what containers to run and in what order. 

From here on out "host" refers to the Gadget compatible hardware running GadgetOS and "host computer" refers to the computer the Gadget compatible hardware is plugged into via USB.

Starting from the top of the file, here is what each section of the gadget.yml does. 

```
spec: "0.0"
name: blink
uuid: e6aa1456-8a4c-44d3-9c0a-06c9b8d1a96c
type: docker
```

There are two sections to place and define containers in: **onboot** and **services**. 

```
onboot:
```

Containers added to the **onboot** section run after boot, then exit. They run before containers placed in **services** and when multiple containers are defined they run sequentially from top to bottom. 

Add a container to onboot:

`gadget add onboot projectname`
	
From parent directory:
	
`gadget -C blink add onboot projectname`

```
services
```

Containers defined under **services** run on boot and are automatically restarted by Docker if it exits with a non-zero return code. Containers here will run after one in **onboot**.

**name** - Name of project
	Generated by `gadget add service|onboot imageName`. If you choose to edit this field after generation the container will need to be built and deployed again.
	
**uuid** - Unique container ID
	You can have several instances of the same image. You can identify these by their uuid. For example, on your host machine if you 
	`gadget shell`
	and run:
	`docker images`
	Several instances of an image which each of their uuids will show.
	
**image** - Pathname of Docker Hub image
	Generated by `gadget add service|onboot imageName`. Currently, it's format is: `parent_directory/projectname. 
	
**directory** - Pathname of local image
	Used when building and deploying images on your host machine. Put the pathname of you Dockerfile and supporting files (called the build's context) here in relation to the gadget.yml file.
	
**net** - 

**pid** - 

**readonly** - Set to false by default
**command** - The command that should run on the container when it starts.
	For example, to run the executable myPythonScript.py as soon as the container starts ['myPythonScript.py'] 
	
**binds** -  Mount a directory into container
	Put any directories here that you would like to mount from the host (GadgetOS) 
	GadgetCLI does not enable you to disable the security labeling for a container with the `--privileged` flag.

**capabilities** - 

**devices** - Define and make a device accessible in a container
If you want to use a device from the host (GadgetOS) you need to define it here. 

**Note:** GadgetCLI does not enable you to disable the security labeling for a container with the `--privileged` flag.



General Rules

* When listing items in an array, surround each item with single quotes. For example:
	`binds: ['/sys:/sys']`
	`command: ['python', 'myScript.py']`
