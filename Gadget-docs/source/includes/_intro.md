# Welcome to Gadget!

<span style="font-size: 36px">&#128226;</span> Welcome to the **developer preview** of Gadget, a suite of tools for developing, deploying, and distributing your applications to C.H.I.P. Pro. 

<aside class="notice">
Gadget is open source and being actively developed, and we want to know what you think about it. </aside>

The best way to leave us feedback is to submit changes to the [Gadget Community Preview](https://github.com/NextThingCo/gadget-community-preview) GitHub repo. For general feedback and questions Lara and David will be available through the Chipster Slack channel.

# What is Gadget? 
Gadget is made up of two pieces of software that work together to simplify embedded software development:

<span style="color: EB008B">**GadgetCLI**</span> is a command-line tool you use on your development machine. It lets you manage your code, add and build containers, and deploy your finished projects to Gadget supported hardware such as C.H.I.P. Pro. 

**Supported Systems:**

* Linux 64-bit
* OSX 
* Windows 10 Pro 64-bit

<span style="color: EB008B">**GadgetOS**</span> is a buildroot-based Linux operating system. It boots quickly, takes up a small amount of NAND, and is designed to work with GadgetCLI.

Buildroot is at the core of GadgetOS and features Docker support and GadgetOSD. **GadgetOSD** is a daemon that allows automatic communication with GadgetCLI over a USB connection. For more information on Buildroot, read [here](https://buildroot.org/).

* What's the boot time? crunch
* How much NAND is taken up? crunch
