# Welcome to Gadget!

<span style="font-size: 36px">&#128226;</span> Welcome to the **developer preview** of Gadget, a suite of tools for developing, deploying, and distributing your applications to C.H.I.P. Pro and Gadget supported hardware. 

<aside class="notice">
Gadget is open source and being actively developed, and we want to know what you think about it. </aside>

The best way to leave us feedback is to submit changes to the [Gadget Community Preview](https://github.com/NextThingCo/gadget-community-preview) GitHub repo. 

# What is Gadget? 
Gadget is made up of two pieces of software that work together to simplify embedded software development.

1) <span style="color: EB008B">**GadgetCLI**</span> is a command-line tool you use on your development machine. It lets you manage your code, add and build containers, and deploy your finished projects to Gadget supported hardware. 

**Supported Systems:**

* Linux 64-bit
* OSX 
* Windows 10 Pro 64-bit

2) <span style="color: EB008B">**GadgetOS**</span> is a buildroot-based Linux operating system. It boots quickly, takes up a small amount of NAND, and is designed to work with GadgetCLI.

Buildroot is at the core of GadgetOS and features Docker support and GadgetOSD. **GadgetOSD** is a daemon that allows automatic communication with GadgetCLI over a USB connection. For more information on Buildroot, read [here](https://buildroot.org/).
