# Workshop Materials

Would you like to run a workshop using PocketC.H.I.P.? Here you will find helpful materials for use in the classroom or while developing your own curriculum. [Pico-8](https://docs.nextthing.co/pocketchip.html#pico-8) the fantasy console used to play, create, and share games has proven to be excellent for exercises emphasizing programming and game design skills. We have created several step-by-step documents in response to the many requests we have received asking for example workshop outlines and getting started materials.

## Getting Started
These introductory materials are written for educators but can be used in educational material for students as-is or partially. They will teach you the basics needed in order to lead an activity using PocketC.H.I.P. and Pico-8.
