## Building a Product with C.H.I.P. Pro

###  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be software and hardware compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro and the GR8 module?

GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processor that is in C.H.I.P., so your C.H.I.P. software is 100% compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro. We believe you shouldn’t have to change your software to go into production. 

To see some of the hardware differences between C.H.I.P. and C.H.I.P. Pro take a look at our [comparison chart](http://ntc-docs-unstable.surge.sh/chip_pro.html#c-h-i-p-v-c-h-i-p-pro). Still have questions? Feel free to contact us at [pro@nextthing.co](mailto:pro@nextthing.co).

### What certifications and directives is C.H.I.P. Pro in compliance with?

* CE
* IC
* FCC (Part 15 Modular Certification)
* Reach
* RoHS

Visit our [Compliance Statement](https://docs.getchip.com/chip_pro.html#compliance-statement) section for more information.

### I am interested in creating a PCB using C.H.I.P. Pro, where do I start? 

To get started, refer to our [PCB Design Guide](http://ntc-docs-unstable.surge.sh/chip_pro.html#pcb-design-tips). If you need further guidance, you will find recommendations of services to help aid you in PCB design and fabrication. We are also happy to do a PCB review and help where we can. If you have questions reach out to us by emailing [pro@nextthing.co](mailto:pro@nextthing.co).

### Do you offer custom flashing solutions?
We offer flashing of custom firmware at the factory for an extra fee when you purchase 1K+ C.H.I.P. Pros.

## GR8 Module

### How much does GR8 cost?
Gr8 costs $6 in any quantity.  

### Where can I purchase GR8?
Contact us at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co) to tell us more about your product and to set up a purchase order.

### What are the GR8’s dimensions?
14mm x 14mm x 0.8mm

### What is the GR8 package?
GR8 is built within a 252 ball FBGA (Fine Pitch Ball Grid Array) package, 0.8mm pitch.

### I have a prototype of my product, should I choose C.H.I.P. Pro or GR8 to move forward with?

This depends on your product's needs and your company's resources. For most customers, C.H.I.P. Pro will be the best and most convenient way to work with the GR8 SiP. C.H.I.P. Pro contains 127 already sourced components including a power management unit (PMU), micro USB port, WiFi, Bluetooth and more. 

If you have tried C.H.I.P. Pro and have found that you need a different layout and different functionality, then designing around GR8 is a great option. You can find out everything that GR8 has to offer in the GR8 [datasheet](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware/tree/master/Datasheets).

### I’m a distributor, can I carry GR8?
Yes! Contact us at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co).
