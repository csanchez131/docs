## Building a Product with C.H.I.P. Pro

###  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be software and hardware compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro and the GR8 module?

GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processor that is in C.H.I.P., so your C.H.I.P. software is 100% compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro. We believe you shouldn’t have to change your software to go into production. 

The biggest difference between C.H.I.P. Pro and C.H.I.P. is the amount of flash memory available. C.H.I.P. Pro offers 512 MB compared to C.H.I.P.'s 4 GB. See how else the hardware included with C.H.I.P. Pro differs from C.H.I.P. by referencing this [comparison chart](http://ntc-docs-unstable.surge.sh/chip_pro.html#c-h-i-p-v-c-h-i-p-pro).

This depends on your product's needs and your company's resources. For most customers, C.H.I.P. Pro will be the best and most convenient way to work with the GR8. It contains 127 already sourced components including a power management unit (PMU), micro USB port, WiFi, Bluetooth and more.
