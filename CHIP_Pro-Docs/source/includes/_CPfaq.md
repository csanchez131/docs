## Building a Product with C.H.I.P. Pro

###  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be software compatible with CHIP Pro and the GR8 module it runs on?

Yes! GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processor that is in C.H.I.P., so your C.H.I.P. software is 100% compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro. We believe you shouldnâ€™t have to change your software to go into production. 

The biggest difference between C.H.I.P. Pro and C.H.I.P. is the amount of flash memory available. C.H.I.P. Pro offers 512 MB compared to C.H.I.P.'s 4 GB. 

### What certifications and directive is C.H.I.P. Pro in compliance with?

* CE
* IC
* FCC (Part 15 Modular Certification)
* Reach
* RoHS
