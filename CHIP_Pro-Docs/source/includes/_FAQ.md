##Ordering

As many or as few as you’d like. 1 to 1 million (or more). For larger orders, hit us up at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co)

### Where can I buy C.H.I.P. Pro?
Currently, we’re offering the C.H.I.P. Pro Dev kit for $49 in our [web store](https://nextthing.co/pages/chippro).

### Are there quantity discounts?

###  What is the lead time on a C.H.I.P. Pro order?

##Hardware

### Is C.H.I.P. Pro open source?
Yes, you can see our design files in our [git repository](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware).

###  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be hardware and software compatible with GR8?
Yes! GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processor that is in C.H.I.P., so your C.H.I.P. software is 100% compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro. We believe you shouldn’t have to change your software to go into production.

### Does C.H.I.P. Pro replace C.H.I.P.?
C.H.I.P. is still a huge part of what we do. We made C.H.I.P. Pro and Gadget so the enterprising members of the CHIPster community would have a great option for scalable hardware, software and infrastructure for their products.

### What does FCC Modular Certification mean?
C.H.I.P. Pro is CE, IC, and FCC Part 15 Modular Transmitter certified for use with multiple commercially available [external antennas](https://docs.getchip.com/chip_pro_devkit.html#wifi-antenna). Read our compliance statement for more information.
