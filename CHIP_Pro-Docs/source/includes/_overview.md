The C.H.I.P. Pro System-on-Module (SOM) is designed to get you making great products instead of re-inventing computers. It's a low-cost, high-capability module that lets you focus on fast iterations of brilliant ideas that will be ready to manufacture.

To get the most out of developing and designing for C.H.I.P. Pro we recommend prototyping with the [C.H.I.P. Pro Development Kit](http://docs.getchip.com/chip_pro_devkit.html). 

C.H.I.P. Pro is a breadboard-friendly and surface-mount-ready computer designed from the ground up to power the next generation of smart devices. 

This document provides technical details that will make integrating the C.H.I.P. Pro module into your designs a breeze. Along with technical specifications and basic guides to get you connected and working with software on the C.H.I.P. Pro. 

C.H.I.P. Pro's Features:

* 512MB of high-speed NAND storage
* WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity
* power and battery management
* pins for popular I/O busses
* USB gadget
* the verstatility of mainline Linux 
* dimensions: 45mm x 30mm

Comprehensive audio handling includes:

* 24-bit ADC/DAC for stereo audio in and out
* one-wire audio digital out
* I2S digital audio for interfacing with professional audio DACs.

**Certifications**

C.H.I.P. Pro is CE, IC, and FCC part 15 modularly certified, making integration into end products easy. 

**WiFi and Bluetooth**

The on-board Realtek 8723DS combination module provides compliant Wi-Fi B/G/N and Bluetooth 4.2 Low-Energy connectivity. A software controlled antenna path selects between the on-board chip antenna or a uFL antenna connector where several pre-certified antennas can be added to boost wireless transmit and receive range. 

**Power Management**

Charge or power from an AC/DC adapter or power it from USB or a rechargable battery. On-board Power management with the AXP209 provides plenty of power options to better match your applications: mobile, industrial, and low-power are all possible with C.H.I.P. Pro.

C.H.I.P. Pro is powered by GR8, a system-in-package (SiP) that was designed by us at Next Thing Co. 

GR8 SiP Features:

* 1GHz Next Thing Co. GR8 ARM Cortex-A8 with ARMv7 instruction set and NEON coprocessor
* Mali-400 GPU supporting OpenGL ES1.1/ 2.0 and OpenVG 1.1
* 256MB of Nanya DDR3 DRAM
* 14mm x 14mm FBGA package 

More information about the GR8 SiP can be found in the [GR8 data sheet](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware/raw/master/Datasheets/GR8_Datasheet_v1.0.pdf)
