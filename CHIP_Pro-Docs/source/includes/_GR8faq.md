## I have a prototype of my product, should I choose C.H.I.P. Pro or GR8 to move forward with?

This depends on your product's needs and your company's resources. For most customers, C.H.I.P. Pro will be the best and most convenient way to work with the GR8 SiP. C.H.I.P. Pro contains 127 already sourced components including a power management unit (PMU), micro USB port, WiFi, Bluetooth and more. 

If you have tried C.H.I.P. Pro and have found that you need a different layout and different functionality, then designing around GR8 is a great option. You can find out everything that GR8 has to offer in the GR8 [datasheet](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware/tree/master/Datasheets).

## I’m a distributor, can I carry GR8?
Yes! Contact us at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co).
