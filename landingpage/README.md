# Documentation Landing Page
These files make the landing page for [docs.getchip.com](http://docs.getchip.com). The rendered HTML from this site is monitored by a remote script that will roll this content into the `gh-pages` branch of the [getchip/masterdocs](http://github.com/getchip/masterdocs) repository.

# Render!
The CSS is compiled through sass and the gulp task runner. Be sure to `npm install` the dependencies before you can `gulp` to render the static page.
