## FAQ

### Can I play HD videos on C.H.I.P.?


### Can I use the composite video at the same time as a video out DIP?
No. The composite video output from both the 3.5mm TRRS jack and the pin headers on C.H.I.P. are disabled when the VGA and HDMI DIPS are in place.

### How can I hear audio when I'm using HDMI?
The HDMI signal from the HDMI DIP only carries video, so it is not possible to direct audio streams to the HDMI DIP. If you want to hear audio, use the analog stereo audio outputs on the 3.5mm TRRS jack or the pin headers on C.H.I.P. and plug them into an amplifier or powered speaker.

### Can I Use This With PocketC.H.I.P?
No. PocketC.H.I.P. is itself a DIP, and is they are not "stackable." Additionally, PocketC.H.I.P. does not support a second display.
